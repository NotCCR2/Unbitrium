I, the creator of this malware, am not liable for any damages.

# ❤️ For Skidders
I put the source code there only so newcomers could learn GDI, so I licenced Unbitrium with a GNU AGPL 3.0 licence. That way, if you use its source code, you must release the source code of your project, credit me and set the same licence as the original.
